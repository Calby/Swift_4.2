// Challenges

// 1.
/*
 Declare a variable named someValue of type optional Int and assign nil.
 Note: You will have to explicitly declare the type as an optional Int otherwise the compiler cannot infer it.

// 2.
/*
 In the editor, you have a pretty complex dictionary representing a movie. It contains a nested dictionary, which itself contains an array of Strings as a value.
 Your job is to assign the string containing the value for the lead actor (which for the sake of the example is at position 0 in the array) to the variable leadActor.
 Since dictionaries return optional values, you will have to use an if let statement to unwrap each consecutive operation.

// 3.
/*
 In the editor, you have a struct named Book which has few stored properties, two of which are optional.
 Your task is to create a failable initializer that accepts a dictionary of type [String : String] as input and initializes all the stored properties. (Hint: A failable init method is one that can return nil and is written as init?).
 Use the following keys to retrieve values from the dictionary: "title", "author", "price", "pubDate"
 Note: Give your initializer argument the name dict
